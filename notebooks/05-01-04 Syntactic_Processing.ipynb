        "Continuing from our previous challenge, we will explore several crucial techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** beyond basic tokenisation, focusing on **Part-of-Speech (POS)** tagging and various forms of syntactic parsing using the same email summary dataset. We will use the powerful spaCy library for efficient processing and visualisation. The goal is to understand how machines can analyse the grammatical structure of sentences, which is foundational for advanced tasks like *Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and sophisticated Grammar Checking* when performing our analysis using the email dataset."

Understanding these structural relationships is the essential bridge between simple word processing and advanced **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**. The practical example of Subject-Verb Agreement checking demonstrated the immediate, real-world utility of dependency parsing in building sophisticated language tools.\n",
