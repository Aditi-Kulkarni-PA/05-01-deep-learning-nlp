    "## What is POS Tagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical category (or \"tag\") to each word in a sentence. These categories include noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In short:\n",
    "POS tagging answers “what role does each word play in the sentence?”\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Sentence** | The | quick | brown | fox  | jumps | over | the | lazy | dog  |\n",
    "| ------------ | --- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |\n",
    "| **POS Tag**  | DET | ADJ   | ADJ   | NOUN | VERB  | PREP | DET | ADJ  | NOUN |\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Interpretation:\n",
    "- “The” → determiner\n",
    "- “quick” / “brown” / “lazy” → adjectives\n",
    "- “fox” / “dog” → nouns\n",
    "- “jumps” → verb\n",
    "- “over” → preposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why POS Tagging Matters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning each word in a sentence to a grammatical category such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. For example: \n",
    "- The child plays happily → child (noun), plays (verb), happily (adverb) \n",
    "\n",
    "This is significant because the same word can take on different roles depending on the context: \n",
    "- She read a book → Here, book is a noun. \n",
    "- Please book a ticket → Here, book is a verb. \n",
    " \n",
    "POS tagging helps resolve such ambiguities by analysing how each word functions within the sentence. In a machine-readable format, the same sentence would be tagged as follows: \n",
    "- The/DT child/NN plays/VBZ happily/RB \n",
    "\n",
    "Words also fall into these two broad categories: \n",
    "- **Open-class words**: Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs; these carry meaning and expand as new words are created, such as selfie or googling. \n",
    "- **Closed-class words**: Pronouns, articles, prepositions and conjunctions; these form the grammatical backbone of language and rarely change. \n",

    "- Auxiliaries and verbs: She has finished, They are running \n",
    "- Coordination: with and, subjects become plural (A dog and a cat are outside); with or, the verb often agrees with the nearest subject (A dog or two cats are outside) \n",
    " \n",
    "However, there are some tricky cases, such as the following: \n",
    "- Attractors, where an extra noun nearby misleads agreement, as in ‘The bouquet of roses is on the table’ \n",
    "- Existential sentences, where the true subject comes after there, as in ‘There are many options’ \n",
    "- Indefinite pronouns, such as each or everyone, which usually take singular verbs \n",
