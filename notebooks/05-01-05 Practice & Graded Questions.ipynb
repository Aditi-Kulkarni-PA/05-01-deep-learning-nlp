    "- Lexical processing deals with words and their meanings — identifying parts of speech, word forms, and vocabulary (e.g., tokenization, stemming, lemmatization).\n",
    "- Syntactic processing focuses on sentence structure — how words combine to form grammatically valid sentences (e.g., parsing, POS tagging).\n",
